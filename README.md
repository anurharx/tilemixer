## TILEMIXER

#### About TileMixer
TileMixer splits a photo into a grid of tiles, shuffles or rearranges them, and lets you export either the full shuffled collage or each individual tile as a ZIP. All processing happens in your browser — files are not uploaded to any server.

#### Features
- Split image into a customizable grid (Columns × Rows).
- Preview the shuffled collage before download.
- Toggle visible tile numbers for easy placement and reconstruction.
- Download the full collage (JPEG) or all tiles as a ZIP of JPGs.
- Drag & drop to reorder tiles directly in the preview (swap tiles).
- Drag & drop a file onto the canvas area to load an image when empty.
